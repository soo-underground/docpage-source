# MkDocs
This website is written in markdown and powered by MkDocs.

<summary>why I'm using markdown?</summary>
<br>
For a simple website that has exactly one contributor, [DITA XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture) seems like an awfully complex choice. Plus, I already spend up to 8 hours a day doing DITA at work ;)

This means that my source files are stored in a github repo and turned into HTML with the help of MkDocs engine. Since by default MkDocs style and syntax are not that rich, I'm using [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme and [fenced-code-tabs](https://github.com/yacir/markdown-fenced-code-tabs) markdown extention.
