# MkDocs
This website is written in markdown and powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).

why markdown?

* easy to start
* easy to modify css and even js
* easy to work with docs as code
</details>

The source files are stored in a github repo and turned into HTML. Since by default MkDocs style and syntax are not that rich, I'm using [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme and [fenced-code-tabs](https://github.com/yacir/markdown-fenced-code-tabs) markdown extention.
