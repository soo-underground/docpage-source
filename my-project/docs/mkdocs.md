# MkDocs
This website is written in markdown and powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).

<summary>why markdown?</summary>
<br>
For a simple website that has exactly one contributor, [DITA XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture) seems like an awfully complex tool.

This means that source files are stored in a github repo and turned into HTML with the help of MkDocs engine. Since by default MkDocs style and syntax are not that rich, I'm using [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme and [fenced-code-tabs](https://github.com/yacir/markdown-fenced-code-tabs) markdown extention.
