# Welcome to test doc site

# Welcome page
This is a test docpage, here I try to create a mockup documentation website.

<!-- Right now I'm trying to document an API of an imaginary note service. -->

[API access](api.md) should have all the details about using the API.

<!-- API endpoints should be an example on how to document a particular api methods.-->

##Technical info:
The website is written in markdown, all the source files are [in a separate repository](https://github.com/soo-underground/docpage-source).
It's all built together using MKDocs [mkdocs.org](http://mkdocs.org) and hosted w/ Github Pages.
