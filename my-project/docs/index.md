# Welcome page
This is a test docpage, here I am trying to create a documentation website.

Right now there's not much going on here. Hopefully, in the nearest future this website will contain following chapters:

* [Engine](mkdocs.md) should have all the info on how I use the mkdocs engine for this website.
* [Continuous Integration](markdown.md) should have all the info about building and deploying my docs.
* [Changelog](changelog.md) should list major "releases" and release notes.
* [Contacts](contacts.md)  should have my contact info.

<!-- ##Technical info:
The website is written in markdown, all the source files are [in a separate repository](https://github.com/soo-underground/docpage-source).
It's all built together using MKDocs [mkdocs.org](http://mkdocs.org) and hosted w/ Github Pages. -->
